## Abstract
Hello fellow devs! When's the last time you had a great idea? What did you do with that idea? Does it live somewhere you can acess when you need it most? Well, let us introduce you to the Ideabox storage app! We kept it simple and user friendly. Name your idea and add necessary details to one card. If you're a fan of that ideacard, you can favorite it and keep it for as long as you'd like. If not, you can delete it! Boom-Bang-Bow!

## Set Up Instructions
- Step 1: Fork repository
- Step 2: Clone repository onto local machine
- Step 3: Change directory (cd) into newly cloned directory
- Step 4: Open index.html file in browser
- Step 5: Now try out an Ideacard and all of it's functions!

## Context
This app was created during the fourth week at Turing School of Software and Design. It took us approximately 20 hours to design the app.
