## Context** (time allotted, # of people, mod, learning goals)
This app was created during the fourth week at Turing School of Software and Design. It took us approximately 20 hours to design the app.

## Learning Goals
- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

## Wins/Challenges
The team recorded and celebrated our wins each day. Some of those included: 
Working on separate features, 
Merging multiple branches, 
Good communication, 
Sticking to poms and breaks, 
Atomic commits. 
Meeting our goals for finishing features each day

## Future Additions** (these should be entered as Issues and on your Project Board as well)
